Create new 10 faux pas stories and 10 control stories, make sure that (1) the stories are divers with different topics, places, names, situations, emotions 
(2) the stories contain conversation (at least 2 different quotes), 
(3) in the faux pas stories there is a sentence to cite which could be the answer to "What did they say that they should not have said?" 
(4) the faux pas story contain a character that didn't know/remember something and that's what causes the faux pas. 
(5) the control stories are similar to the faux pas stories, and that contains some conversation that might confuse like as if it contains a faux pas, but without faux pas

I met this new boy at my college. In the beginning we got on well. As the conversation went on at the cafeteria though he seemed cold and he did seem to be annoyed about something. I had a feeling he might have just missed my name or something, and I had a feeling he didn't mind. He wasn't really looking to get on well, he was just looking for some place to sit down and talk with someone other than me. I think I sounded as though I was putting up for a friend. I could have saved him the trouble. I didn't mean to embarrass him by taking it out on his new friend. He seemed to be just wanting to talk to me about something else in class.
--------------------------------------
A speaker says something when they don't think it's a good idea to say it. They should consider whether or not a listener would like to hear it in the first place.
