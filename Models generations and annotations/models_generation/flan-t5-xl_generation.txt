You are supposed to put some sort of a guideline on the faux pas stories stating which sentence you are looking for which is what might have been the faux pas sentence, and what sentence you are looking for the control stories about, which is without that sentence. And you may decide to have two different scenarios of two different control stories, where the character doesn't say anything they shouldn't, and where they say something they shouldn't.

i.e. they didn't realize that his story was wrong
